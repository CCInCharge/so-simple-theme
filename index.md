Hello! I'm a Data Engineering fellow at [Insight Data Engineering](http://insightdataengineering.com/), a fellowship program - I'm currently working on developing a data pipeline for a big data project. I received my Aerodynamics Engineering Bachelors and Masters degrees from the University of Southern California (2015), and am currently working on wrapping up another Bachelors in Computer Science at Oregon State University (2018).

In addition to my current specialties in Data Engineering and Software Development, I have previously worked professionally as an Aerodynamics Engineer at Boeing (2015-2017). Additionally, I have experience with working with smaller teams during my time as an Aerodynamics Captain and Program Manager at USC's AeroDesign Team. I enjoy not only collaborating with fellow data engineers and software engineers to solve problems, but also using my unique experiences to bring a different perspective and leadership knowledge to those I'm fortunate enough to work with.

When I'm not committing to GitHub, you'll likely find me enjoying the many coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area, hiking, biking, rock climbing, or volunteering with [CAL-ESAR](http://www.cal-esar.org/), a local wilderness search and rescue team.
